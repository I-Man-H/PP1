# KPI for Responsible Innovation
The list of KPI for Responsible Innovation can be accessed [here](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/mod/resource/view.php?id=2805714).

These are outcome-based statements which you can use in your project and also your future career to measure if you are on the right track to meet your goals for being a responsible innovator.

  1. In groups (4-5), I want you to discuss about each row (e.g. diversity/gender equality, public and ethical issues). \[10 minutes\]
  2. Change the groups (4-5) randomly so that you will have an opportunity to discuss another KPI with new people. \[10 minutes\]
  3. Describe these KPIs in your own words to the whole class.

# Group Project

In your group, discuss how you can use the insight from today‚Äôs tutorial about responsible innovation, including the KPI list, for your own group project.

# Meeting Minutes
Meeting minutes are an important tool for capturing the key points and decisions made during a meeting. They serve as a record of what was discussed, what decisions were made, and what actions need to be taken.

This is to take your group project seriously and stay on track, while providing me with a clear record of your progress and identifying any potential issues or areas where you may need additional support.

As part of your tutorial contribution, I want you to submit at least **one** meeting minutes every two weeks.

Please follow these steps:
1. Create a folder on OneDrive.
2. Name the folder as "ENGN/COMP6250-T03/T04-Group#-MeetingMinutes
3. Share the folder with all of your group memebrs.
4. Share the folder with me (iman.hosseini@anu.edu.au).
5. Upload your meeting minute to this folder at least once every two weeks.
6. Each group member should take turns in writing the meeting minutes.

**Note:** Each group should have at least 4 meeting minutes by the end of Week 12.

There are many templates (word, latex etc.) available online you can use. You may also create your own template.
