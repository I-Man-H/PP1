# Week 5: Mapping The Ecosystem

## Quote of the Day
**“Don’t ever let somebody tell you you can’t do something, not even me. Alright? You dream, you gotta protect it. People can’t do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can’t do it. If you want something, go get it. Period.”** 
The Pursuit of Happyness

## Key Resources
  * Reed, Mark S., et al. (2009). Who's in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management. Journal of environmental management 90.5: 1933-1949. \[[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709000024)\]


## Learning Outcome:

  * Using ecosystem mapping as an approach to move beyond technical systems and see all social and environmental systems involved.

## Class Discussion: Definition

1. What does Ecosystem Mapping mean?
2. Who is stakeholder and why?
3. How can we identify key actors or stakeholders to assess their interests in any given system (e.g. AI system, Water system, Wind energy system)?
4. How can we map out the ecosystem of our work? What does that even mean?

## Class Discussion:

Why having a sound process for identifying/analysing stakeholders is important for a responsible thinking and practice?

## Case Scenarios:

### Case Scenario 1: Adani's Carmichael Mine

Watch this [video](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/adani-is-just-not-going-to-happen-20160404-gnxwkl.html) about Adani's Carmichael mine in Queensland.

Imagine you work for an Environmental NGO which aims to limit the environmental impacts of the Adani Carmichael Mine.

  * Use the stakeholder analysis to map and discuss the stakeholders you need to be aware of for this project (i.e. to limit the environmental impacts of the Adani Carmichael Mine).
  * Use “Rainbow diagram” for classifying stakeholders (Figure 2 in Reed’s paper). Alternatively, you can use the "" diagram.

Discuss this in your group for about 20 minutes. Share your group discussion results/ideas in Padlet. Make sure to include the name of the scenario in the subject.

### Case Scenario 2: COVID-19 Problem At ANU

  * Identify and justify all stakeholders involved in different systems (education, health, immigration, etc).
  * Use the "Rainbow diagram” for classifying stakeholders. You can use the "" diagram alternatively.

You may think of the following questions:

  1. What are the stakeholders involved?
  2. What are their interest and power?
  3. How are they connected? 

 Discuss this in your group for about 20 minutes. Share your group discussion results/ideas in Padlet. Make sure to include the name of the scenario in the subject.
