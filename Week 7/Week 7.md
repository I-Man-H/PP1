## What is a Toolkit?

* A toolkit is a collection of authoritative and adaptable resources that enables practitioners to learn about an issue and identify approaches for addressing them.
* Toolkits can help translate theory into practice, and typically target one issue or one audience.

## Why do we create  a Toolkit?

* It can offer practical advice and guidance regarding an issue of concern or importanceâ€”especially when the issue is emerging or evolving.
* The tool does not need to introduce the user to the full potential of the framework/concept (e.g. ethical thinking, responsible innovation). Rather it should be well suited to create a good first impression and raise interest in learning more about it!

## Steps to Creating a Toolkit

1. Identify the issue (what practitioners need to learn more about it, e.g. ethical practice, systems thinking, responsible innovation)
2. Identify the key audience(s) for the toolkit
3. Determine the scope of the toolkit
4. Come up with a strategy for collecting content (case- studies, best practices, models, moral conundrum etc.)
5. Come up with an innovative idea to translate the content into a tool
6. Build/Create
