## Think About These Questions
1. What is a system? What is feedback?
2. How things outside your boundary area affect things within (think about a project you are working on)?
3. What are those things? How do they drive change?
4. How can you show the connections between different systems involved in your project? 

## Introduction
1. What is System Thinking?
2. What is Analytic Thinking?
3. What are the differences between Analytic Thinking and System Thinking?
