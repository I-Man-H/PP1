You can complete the quiz to test your learning. It's not weighted.  


Note : What you will learn here (i.e. technical report writing), may not applicable to your group report assignment.  For more information about your writing assignment please refer to the seminar in week 2. 


## What are technical reports?

Technical report writing is common in engineering and computer science. A report is a specific form of writing, written concisely and clearly and typically organised around identifying and examining issues, events, or findings from a research investigation. It needs to be structured around your key message (ASLC, 2020). 

Watch this short video about [Report Writing from UniSA (2019)](https://lo.unisa.edu.au/mod/book/view.php?id=1144638&chapterid=167261) (2.53 mins). Also download and view the useful resources on this page, including sample engineering reports, style guides and guides to technical writing.


Structuring technical reports
Technical reports are expected to be well written, clearly structured and expressed in a way that suits the particular audience. Results and analysis should be accurate, clear and objective. Report structures can vary depending on the purpose for writing the report and the audience but whatever the format, the structure needs to support the key message.

Reports are generally structured to suit the needs of the particular project and audience however they typically contain:

  * Title page
  * Executive summary/abstract
  * Table of contents
  * Introduction
  * Body
  * Conclusion
  * References
  * Appendices

Watch this video from Griffith University on a [Guide to Writing Reports](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-health/learning-and-teaching/transition-and-tertiary-preparedness/guide-to-writing-research-reports) (10.14 mins). The video presentation from Griffith University outlines the ‘traditional’ structure of a research report, highlighting the key information that is usually presented in each section.
