## Reflective Writing


This week we will look at Reflective Writing. Self reflection is important to succeed in professional world because you need to recognise and clarify the important connections between what you already know and what you are learning. It helps you to become an active, aware and critical learner both when it comes to planning your career and reflecting on practice as an engineer and computer scientist.


UNSW (2019) chapter on [Reflective Writing](https://student.unsw.edu.au/reflective-writing) discusses elements of reflective thinking and writing, and includes supplementary pages on [How do I write reflectively](https://student.unsw.edu.au/how-do-i-write-reflectively) and [Examples of Reflective Writing](https://student.unsw.edu.au/examples-reflective-writing).

## Gibbs Reflective Cycle


Gibbs' Reflective Cycle was developed by Graham Gibbs in 1988 to give structure to learning from experiences.  It offers a framework for examining experiences, and given its cyclic nature lends itself particularly well to repeated experiences, allowing you to learn and plan from things that either went well or didnâ€™t go well. 

This 6-step cycles discusses the structure of reflection focusing on what happened and how you can improve for future similar situation. You can use this model to improve a particular area in your workplace or as a conversation for improvement with your peers. 

It covers these 6 stages. [Read more about these steps here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/gibbs-reflective-cycle).

  * Description of the experience
  * Feelings and thoughts about the experience
  * Evaluation of the experience, both good and bad
  * Analysis to make sense of the situation
  * Conclusion about what you learned and what you could have done differently
  * Action plan for how you would deal with similar situations in the future, or general changes you might find appropriate.

This is just one model of reflection. Use the six steps when writing or reflecting in practice. Test it out and see how it works for you. If you find that only a few of the questions are helpful for you, focus on those.
