# Lesson 2: Improving your writing using Turnitin

## Welcome
Where should text matches appear in your work? 

This is a question that can help you to improve your overall writing and assignment structure. In this module, we explain where markers typically expect to find text matches, and where they don't. Typically, text matches are not found in introductions, topic sentences, or conclusions. We also show how you can use Turnitin to see whether your own voice needs to be more prominent in an assignment. 

At the end of this module, there is a short quiz of 4 questions to help you test your understanding of how Turnitin can be used to improve assignment structure and authorial voice.

## Authorial Voice
As well as being useful for checking your paraphrasing, quotations, and referencing, Turnitin can be a useful tool to help figure out whether your argument is clear. It can also be used to check whether you have not used enough, or have used too many sources. If you don't use enough sources, then your argument might be weak. If you use too many sources, then your own answer to the question might get lost amidst other people's words. This module provides strategies and tips for how to write clearly and persuasively. 

### What is authorial voice?
When writing assignments, it is important that you use your own words to state your argument or answer to the assignment question. This is called your authorial voice, and is key to your development as a scholar because it shows the skill with which you are able to evaluate sources and make your own argument. 

For example, consider the following two thesis statements. Both of them answer the question "How significant are the long term effects of having had a childhood imaginary companion?"

Why do you think the second thesis statement is clearer? 

|  |
| -- | 
| Thesis statement 1: | 
| Regarding psychological functions, the significance for adults of the impact of childhood imaginary companions is complex. |
| Thesis statement 1: |
| I argue that the long term effects of having had a childhood imaginary companion are not significant, because they do not impinge on adults' psychological functions. |

The second thesis statement is clearer because it contains a direct answer to the question. It answers the question of "how significant are the long term effects?" by answering "the long term effects ... are not significant". In contrast, the first thesis statement sounds more like a general fact. The idea that the effects are "complex" sounds vague and does not explicitly answer the question. When writing a thesis statement or key message for an assignment, aim to directly answer the question.

The second thesis statement is also clearer because the student has used the first person "I". The next section discusses how and when to use the first person.

### Should I use the first person? 
In many disciplines it is acceptable to use the first person (for example, statements that include "I" or "my"). However, if you are uncertain, you should check with your lecturer whether they want you to use it. 

The first person can often help to make your argument clearer. For example, consider the following two extracts from introductions. 

| |
| -- | 
| **Statement 1:** |
| Nuclear proliferation has been an ongoing source of international tension since the end of the Cold War. Although some governments call for either total nuclear disarmament or strict regulations on nuclear armament, many states continue to equip themselves with nuclear weapons. Given the potentially dire consequences of a lack of regulation, international organisations have attempted to coordinate international regulations. However, there is much debate about whether these actions are effective (reference). I argue that while nuclear proliferation is unlikely to be prevented, international organisations do have the capacity to effectively regulate the process of armament. Using examples from India, America, and Russia, I demonstrate how international organisations have employed a range of successful regulations. |
| ** Statement 2:** |
| Nuclear proliferation has been an ongoing source of international tension since the end of the Cold War. Although some governments call for either total nuclear disarmament or strict regulations on nuclear armament, many states continue to equip themselves with nuclear weapons. Given the potentially dire consequences of a lack of regulation, international organisations have attempted to coordinate international regulations. However, there is much debate about whether these actions are effective (reference). Nuclear proliferation is unlikely to be prevented, although international organisations do have the capacity to effectively regulate the process of armament. Examples from India, America, and Russia, demonstrate how international organisations have employed a range of successful regulations. |


Both of these introductions are fairly clear and make the same argument that international organisations can effectively regulate nuclear proliferation. However, in the first example, it is likely that the reader would be able to identify the student's argument more quickly because they have used "I" in their thesis statement. In the second example, the argument is more implicit. It might take the reader a bit more time to work out which part of the introduction shows the student's argument. 

When using the first person, it is important not to overuse it. If every sentence starts with "I think", "I show", or "my essay" for example, the essay would sound like it was based on opinions rather than analysis of the evidence. This overuse of the first person could make the assignment sound informal. Instead, you can use a mixture of the first and third person in your assignments. 

Another useful way to avoid overusing the first person is to use it only in particular places. These key places are: the thesis statement in the introduction, methodology sections, topic sentences, and conclusions. This is because these areas emphasise your argument (the thesis statement in the introduction, topic sentences, and conclusions) or explain something that you did (methodology sections). Using the first person can make your argument and your actions clear to the reader.

Whether or not you use the first person, in most assignments you need to make your answer clear to your reader. This can be achieved using key phrases that show argumentation and critical evaluation. The following sections look at how you can use Turnitin to improve your writing, and give examples of how to use the language of critical evaluation. 



## How can Turnitin improve my writing?

As well as helping you to check for issues with quoting and paraphrasing, Turnitin can help you to improve your writing by showing you where your own voice needs to be clearer. Your own voice should be placed in a number of key areas in assignments:

  * Introductory thesis statements
  * Topic sentences
  * Conclusions

This means that if you have used a strong authorial voice in these areas, Turnitin should not typically find substantial text matches in your introductory thesis statements, topic sentences, or conclusions. 

So, for example, it is usually an indication that a student has a well-placed argument if the Turnitin report looks like this: 

<img width="462" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 21 55 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225795879-819fef4c-e6bb-4631-b933-f3610bd5649e.png">


In the above example, note that there are no text matches, no quotes, and no paraphrases in the introduction, conclusion, or topic sentences. The text matches occur in the middle of the paragraphs, since the student is using this evidence to support their own argument.

Note too that Turnitin does not identify all the quotes that the student uses - for instance, there is a quote in the third body paragraph that is not highlighted at all. Turnitin does not always identify text matches when you might expect it to, and sometimes it only highlights parts of quotations. This is because the software searches through so many sources in such a short time that it often only identifies the most prevalent matches. Since Turnitin does not necesssarily identify all the sources you use, it is up to you to double check that all your quotes, paraphrasing, and referencing are appropriate. You can find out more about how to check your quotations and paraphrasing in this site. 

The following sections explain more about how to use Turnitin to check your voice in introductions, paragraphs, and conclusions. 

## Turnitin and introductions
When writing introductions, it is important that your own answer to the question and your reasons for your answer are clear. Usually an introduction contains the following elements: 

  * A brief explanation of the background 
  * An outline of why the issue is controversial or debated in the discipline
  * Your thesis statement (i.e. your answer to the assignment question)
  * An outline of the assignment structure that explains where the key reasons for your argument are addressed

Each of these four components usually take up 1-2 sentences. 

### An introduction should mostly consist of your own words
Since the diagram above shows that approximately half of the introduction should be committed to explaining your answer, there shouldn't be a lot of quotes or paraphrasing in it. While you may wish to use evidence to provide context about the issue you are examining, it is preferable to use paraphrasing, and if you want to use quotations, do so sparingly and keep them very brief. If you do this, then it makes it easier for your reader to understand your ideas. Your reader wants to be able to find your key points and your answer to the question easily, so avoid making them wade through a lot of other people's words. 

### An unclear introduction
The image below shows an introduction that uses excessive quotes. This information could be presented more concisely if it was paraphrased instead.

Even more problematic is that the introduction does not answer the essay question directly. Although it tells us that the "essay explores whether apples are better than oranges", and that it's going to look at various topics (chemical compounds, versatility and availability), it does not actually tell us what the writer's answer is. As a reader, you may be left wondering "well, are apples better or not?", or, "why have I just read this introduction if it has no main point?" It would be much better for the writer to tell us their answer - whether they argue that apples are better, whether oranges are better, or whether the two are equally beneficial. 

<img width="709" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 23 24 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225796083-218ebdb6-4a81-4a30-9d44-60bcf7f275d3.png">


### A better introduction
Here's an example of an improved introduction, where you can easily identify the argument (that apples are better). The writer has just used one quotation and has paraphrased the rest of the information. By condensing the information, the writer leaves more space to elaborate on their argument and the reasons for their argument. Note too that even though the essay is written in the third person, the phrase "this essay argues" is used to help the reader to identify the argument quickly and clearly. 


<img width="709" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 24 09 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225796221-0e077366-5c4f-466c-8e5e-5bd8c52d83fc.png">


### An even better introduction
Finally, here's an even better introduction, where the writer has used paraphrasing rather than quotations. This means that the introduction is more concise, and the reader can easily find the writer's answer to the question.

Note also that the placement of the citations show which information comes from which sources. For example, the idea that eating fruit helps to prevent cancer belongs to the first citation from the Cancer Council of Australia, the next idea that eating fruit can help prevent cardio vascular disease belongs to the National Heart Foundation of Australia, and so on. Where you put citations shows the reader which ideas belong to which authors, so when paraphrasing and quoting, place the citations to distinguish different people's ideas from each other's. 


<img width="709" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 24 42 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225796292-3a1b7a23-c8e9-4383-8fd9-c1055a39b4bc.png">

The next section on paragraphing shows you how you can use Turnitin to check whether your topic sentences show your own ideas, and how to identify whether you have used evidence sufficiently in the body of paragraphs. 


## Turnitin and paragraphs

Paragraphs should consist of three main parts:

1. The topic sentence (which explains how the paragraph's main idea answers the assignment question);
2. Supporting evidence and analysis; and 
3. A concluding sentence that explains the link between one paragraph and the next. 

Your own voice should be clear in the topic sentence and the concluding sentence, since in these places you are explaining how you are answering the assignment question. This means that in Turnitin, **text matches should not usually appear in the first or last sentences** of your paragraphs (unless the matches are to miscellaneous words). The middle of the paragraph is typically where text matches appear. 

### A bad paragraph
For example, consider the below example of a paragraph. It is responding to the question "Should Australia be considered a republic?" However, the student's argument is unclear, because they used other people's words in the first sentence. Using a quote in the topic sentence is a problem because it does not tell the reader what the student's own idea is. Instead, the student should rewrite the topic sentence using their own words.

Another problem with this paragraph is that it uses a lot of quotes, which can mean that the student's own voice gets lost amongst the other people's voices. A consequence of this is that the student does not explain how the evidence supports their argument. Are they using this evidence to argue that Australia should be considered a republic or not? Even if you can tell that the student is implying that Australia should not be considered a republic, this type of paragraph forces you to read between the lines, and to guess at their argument. 

<img width="708" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 26 12 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225796519-38b88390-3c25-4f72-a495-d5ce2ae1038b.png">


### A slightly improved paragraph

This paragraph is a revised version of the example above, and it's a better paragraph. Note how the topic sentence now contains the student's own voice (the text match in the topic sentence is only to miscellaneous terms), and the answer to the question is clear. In answer to the assignment question, the student is arguing that Australia cannot be considered a republic. This idea is made clear in the topic sentence, and it's also clear from the topic sentence that the paragraph will focus on the constitutional monarchy system.  

In the middle of the paragraph, the evidence is analysed. If you read through the example, you can see that the student uses the language of critical analysis to show how the evidence helps them to answer the question. First of all, the student uses phrases like "according to Winterton's definition" and "the Australian Constitution" to show where the evidence is from. Secondly, the student uses phrases such as "counter to" and "nevertheless" to show how the ideas in different sentences connect to each other. For instance, the phrases "counter to" and "some might claim" shows that they are presenting a counterargument - a side of the debate which the student does not agree with. In the next sentence, the student uses "nevertheless" to indicate that the following evidence rebuts the counterargument.  

Finally, the student wraps up the paragraph with a sentence that reiterates their argument that Australia cannot be considered a republic. 

Overall the student has paraphrased more than in the first example, which is good. The main weakness of this paragraph, however, is that it still relies substantially on quotations, which makes it a relatively long paragraph. The quotation in the final sentence is particularly problematic, since it ends the paragraph with someone else's words, not the student's own words. As with topic sentences, the final sentences of paragraphs should contain your own voice. Furthermore, the long (indented) quote gives a lot of information which could perhaps be shortened or paraphrased. 

<img width="707" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 30 48 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225797168-a7bbb763-a5e8-4e84-9516-a09b9a29eb26.png">


### A good paragraph
Now consider this paragraph, which is an even better version of the example above. Note how both the topic sentence (still with the technical terms as text matches) and the concluding sentence now contain the student's own voice, and both of these sentences clearly answer the assignment question by arguing that Australia cannot be described as a republic. The evidence is analysed in the middle of the paragraph,and like the example above, the student uses the language of critical analysis to show the connections between ideas and evidence. The long quote has been reduced, which makes this paragraph shorter and easier to read. 


<img width="711" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 31 23 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225797297-065ac17f-355b-47e8-b4af-3bd3ea1499d3.png">


In sum, **typically there should be no text matches in the first or last sentences of your paragraphs**. The middle of the paragraph is where you find text matches and your analysis of the work. Use linking and critical language here to explain how the ideas connect. And in the first and last sentences of the paragraph, explain how the paragraph answers your assignment question.


## Turnitin and conclusions

Conclusions, like introductions, should consist of mostly your own words. They have two main parts:

1. Summarise your argument and the key reasons for your argument
2. Discuss the implications or importance of your argument. This can also be thought of as the "So what?" move, where you ask yourself "What does all of this mean for my topic or field?" 

Conclusions also should not add any new information. This is because the body of the assignment is where you analyse all the relevant material to support your answer. Since conclusions should contain your own words and not add any new information, **text matches are not often seen in a conclusion**. 

### Problems with quotations in a conclusion
Below is an example of a conclusion that uses too much evidence, with two quotations (the pink and red text matches). The essay question is "How would you assess the part played by the international community in bringing about the end to the conflict in former Yugoslavia?" 

Reading through the conclusion, you can find the author's general argument stated in the first sentence, and in the third sentence the author gives a more specific argument with the reasons for their argument (the brown text match is to miscellaneous terms so it is not an issue). However, since so much space in the conclusion is taken up with the two quotations (the pink and the red text matches), the author's own voice gets overshadowed. 

Furthermore, the author doesn't explain the connection between the quotes and their own argument. The first text match is simply inserted in as a stand alone sentence, and the author does not take the time to analyse or refer to it. This means that the quote appears disconnected from the author's own argument, and the reader is forced to interpret it themselves.

Although the second quote is introduced with the phrase "As Sharp claims", the author does not take the time to explain how the quote fits into their argument. In fact, the quote only focuses on the US, France and Britain, whereas the essay question was about the international community, which includes organisations like the United Nations, as well as other countries. Since the author doesn't analyse the quote, the reader could be left to wonder whether the author neglected to address other members of the international community in their response.

Also, the word "claims" suggests that the author does not necessarily agree with Sharp. In fact, the word "claims" indicates that the author thinks that Sharp's ideas are not supported by the evidence. Because the author does not analyse the quote, the reader could be confused about why the author used this quote. 

<img width="708" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 33 02 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225797516-4f488fcb-6f17-4b96-bc22-c783d1ed2862.png">


### Talk about the evidence

Occasionally, you might be tempted to re-iterate one quote or a piece of evidence in the conclusion. Before doing this, consider whether you should instead integrate the quote or evidence into one of your existing paragraphs, or write a new paragraph about it. Only use a quote or piece of evidence in a conclusion if it is concise, relevant, and if you have explained in your own words how the quote or evidence supports your argument. 

In this conclusion, the author uses a long quote at the beginning of the conclusion to emphasise their main point. Note how the author directly refers to the quote, saying "Sharp's quote above", and they explain why they use the quote. This works well because it helps the reader to understand why the quote is necessary for the author's argument.  



<img width="568" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 33 55 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225797650-e757c3f9-c3fb-4578-8848-bdd2401d8d88.png">


### A good conclusion
Here is another good conclusion, where the author has not used any quotations. Note how the author's argument is placed in the first sentence, and they go on to outline the reasons for their argument. Since they don't use any quotes, they have the space to explain their own argument clearly. 

<img width="568" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 34 39 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225797766-dcc0319c-823f-45c9-a5e7-09b4ef2f9d39.png">

## Opening and interpreting turnitin originality report

In this module we look generally at what Turnitin originality reports are and why the similarity percentage is meaningless on its own. Turnitin is used across ANU colleges so you are likely to encounter it during your studies. You may have used Turnitin in the past, but the way it is used at ANU may be different to your previous experience with it. The primary purpose of Turnitin at ANU is as a tool to help you write with academic integrity. Turnitin works by looking for matches between your text and texts within its database and online.


[![Watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/vKb2F1B.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Im3wlg4yHw&t=1s)

### Turnitin originality report
When you submit your work to Turnitin, your assignments are checked against a large database of academic publications and other sources in order to find if there are matching text sections. An Originality Report is generated which indicates what percentage of your work is your own and what percentage comes from other sources. Examples of resources checked are:

  * Electronic books and journals;
  * Websites (such as Wikipedia) and webpages; and
  * Student assignments that have already been submitted through Turnitin at the ANU and other education institutions in Australia, and internationally, that use Turnitin.


If matches are found, the texts within your document are highlighted and linked to the original sources.

Here is an example of an originality report.

<img width="707" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 1 36 37 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225798050-957f9f3d-3876-4de8-8ae1-6701365194f8.png">


By clicking on the the buttons within the report, you can access different views and information. For example, the "Originality" and "GradeMark" buttons in the top left hand corner switch between views of text matches and your marker's comments. On the right hand side, the Match Overview column lists the sources that Turnitin identifies. In the Match Overview, you can click on the links to find out more about those sources and in some cases access those sources (you may not be able to view some sources such as other students' papers). 

To access a Text-Only Report for screen readers, click on the "Navigate to text-only Originality Report" button within the document viewer. The button is located in the bottom right-hand corner of the document viewer. Within the Text-Only Report, highlighted text identifies text matches. Hyperlinks within both the document and the Match Overview provide more detailed information about the text matches.

We highly recommend that you experiment by clicking on various buttons in your originality report. By getting to know the report, you can access different pieces of useful information. 

For more information on how to upload your work, you can go to the [ANU Online page on Turnitin Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for students](https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/software-systems/turnitin/turnitin-frequently-asked-questions-faqs-for-0).

## What does percentage mean
Turnitin gives your work a ‘similarity index’, which is the percentage of text in your assignment that has been matched to other sources. However, this percentage tells you nothing on its own about whether you have referenced or used sources correctly. The Turnitin originality percentage could be large or small for many different reasons.

### Low percentages
A low (e.g. 0 – 15%) percentage could mean:

  * The writer has not used any sources so therefore has not used good academic practice;
  * The writer correctly paraphrased and put in appropriate acknowledgement of their sources;
  * Turnitin simply did not recognise the sources that the writer used.
 
 ### High percentages
A high percentage (e.g. 60%) could mean:

  * The writer has correctly used and acknowledged many references and quotes;
  * The writer used other people’s ideas without rephrasing or acknowledging them;
  * The entire class is doing the same assignment and is using the same sources.

### There is no ideal number - you need to interpret each text match

There are many other reasons why the percentage could be high or low, and Turnitin’s originality percentage does not tell you whether or not you have plagiarised. This means that you need to read your originality report carefully and look at each match to decide if it is an indication of a problem or not. The percentage on its own will not give you this information.

To help interpret your originality report, this site provides examples and explanations of different types of text matches. You can use the navigation pane on the side to go to the examples you are interested in.

Note also that different lecturers will use Turnitin in different ways. For example, you may be able to access the originality report immediately after each upload. This is an option that allows you to check your work multiple times just before you submit the final version. Alternatively, other lecturers may set it up to take 24 hours to process between each upload. This means that if you’d like to check your assignment a few times before you submit the final copy, you need to have your draft ready a few days before the submission date. Ask your lecturers how they have set up Turnitin on their Wattle page, to find out whether you will be able to see your originality reports without delay, or whether it will take 24 hours between each upload.
