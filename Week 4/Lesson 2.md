# Lesson 2: Improving your writing using Turnitin

## Welcome
Where should text matches appear in your work? 

This is a question that can help you to improve your overall writing and assignment structure. In this module, we explain where markers typically expect to find text matches, and where they don't. Typically, text matches are not found in introductions, topic sentences, or conclusions. We also show how you can use Turnitin to see whether your own voice needs to be more prominent in an assignment. 

At the end of this module, there is a short quiz of 4 questions to help you test your understanding of how Turnitin can be used to improve assignment structure and authorial voice.
