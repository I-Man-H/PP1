## Welcome
Recap on the fundamentals of referencing and effective paraphrasing, summarising and quoting.

Please note that the quiz questions are integrated within the lesson. You are allowed to access the lesson content as many times as you wish but quiz questions can only be attempted once. There will be 10 quiz questions.


## Introducing academic integrity

### Academic Integrity
As scholars, we develop our ideas by critically engaging with the work of others. Because other people's work is their intellectual property, in our work we need to show which ideas belong to which authors. The principle of academic integrity is that when we use other people's ideas and work, we must appropriately acknowledge these sources. To appropriately acknowledge our sources, we use referencing styles and rules. We have to reference whenever we use sources either directly (e.g. quoting) or indirectly (e.g. paraphrasing or summarising). Sources not only include writing, but also ideas, figures, images, graphs, data, and so on.

### Plagiarism
What is plagiarism?
Plagiarism occurs when someone tries to pass off another person’s work or ideas as their own. This includes copying, paraphrasing, summarising, or using another person’s intellectual property without appropriate acknowledgement. The charge of plagiarism could lead to failure for the assignment, failure for the whole course, or suspension or termination of your program or study.  

### Accidental plagiarism 
Plagiarism can take many different forms, and the extent to which someone intentionally plagiarises occurs on a spectrum. Sometimes plagiarism is accidental and relatively minor. Accidental examples of plagiarism may, in some cases, be deemed poor academic practice. Examples of these can include:
* Forgetting to put in a reference
* Using quotation marks incorrectly
* Paraphrasing someone else’s words too closely
* Giving an incorrect reference

Accidental plagiarism may occur for a variety of reasons. A student may be unfamiliar with the referencing requirements, or may be in doubt about what needs to be acknowledged.  

If your marker tells you that you have made such mistakes, it is important that you learn how to avoid them before the next assignment. If you submit another assignment with the same mistakes, this could result in an accusation of plagiarism. To learn how to avoid plagiarism, you need to understand how to reference which is covered in later section of this module).

### Deliberate plagiarism 
Deliberate plagiarism can take a range of forms. Some serious examples include:
* Paying someone to do your work for you
* Copying someone else’s work and submitting it as your own
* Using information from the internet, books, and other sources without acknowledgement
* Recycling all or part of an assignment that you completed for another course

The above types of actions are problematic because they do not represent the student’s original work for the particular assignment. These actions could lead to failure for the assignment, failure for the whole course, or suspension or termination of the program or study.  

For further explanation about what constitutes plagiarism, you can access the ANU web page on academic honesty and plagiarism. That web page also has a link to the current Academic Misconduct Rules which gives more details about the definitions of plagiarism, academic integrity, and poor academic practice. 

### How can I avoid plagiarism? 
To avoid plagiarism, students at ANU must apply the principles of academic integrity. Academic integrity generally means that your work has to:
* Be original;
* Be produced for the purposes of a particular assessment task (i.e. you can’t recycle anything you have written for another assignment); and  
* Acknowledge the ideas, scholarship, and intellectual property of others using referencing conventions. In other words, you will need to reference whenever you use someone else’s words, ideas, data, images, scholarship, and any other type of intellectual property.  

You can find more information on referencing conventions on this site as well as on the [ASLC website](https://academicskills.anu.edu.au/). To get individual help with referencing and [academic integrity](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/mod/book/view.php?id=2805730), you can [book an appointment at ASLC](https://academicskills.anu.edu.au/appointments-0), go to an ASLC drop in session, or see your tutor or lecturer in their consultation hours.  


## Referencing basics

### Introduction to referencing
It is very simple to avoid plagiarism. If you get an idea from somewhere else, provide a citation and a reference. If you do this, then the chances of being accused of plagiarism are very low. It is your responsibility to acknowledge the sources you use in your work, using an appropriate and consistent style of referencing. By doing this, you’re acknowledging that you are part of the academic community. It is important to do this so that your reader (or the person assessing your work) can locate the sources you used to check that you have correctly understood them. The reader wants to know where your evidence or support for your argument(s) comes from.

### Where to reference
Although there are a number of different styles of referencing used at ANU, most referencing styles require two main parts to referencing: 

Citations, which appear after the quote or paraphrase in the body of your work; and 
Reference lists, which appear on a separate page at the end of your work, with full referencing information provided in alphabetical order.
For most of your work at ANU, you will have to give both citations and a reference list in each assignment.Usually, the reference list contains one entry for each of the sources that were used in the citations. Unless your marker tells you otherwise, a reference list should not contain anything extra that was not cited in the body of your work.

Citations will look different depending on which referencing style you use. For instance, if you use Chicago or AGLC, citations usually are footnotes. If you use Harvard or APA, citations are in text citations (commonly known as the “author date” system). So to decide which type of citations to use, you first need to select a referencing style guide. There is more information about style guides later in this lesson. Here, we'll just give an overview of what footnotes and in text citations look like. For both examples, the student would also have to provide a reference list at the end of their assignment. 

#### Part 1: Footnotes or in text citations?
Footnotes

Here is an example that uses footnotes, using the Oxford style of referencing. Notice how in the body of the assignment there are superscript numbers that match to the citations that appear at the bottom of the page. 

In text citations

Here is an example that uses in text citations, using a Harvard style of referencing.

Notice how in the first two citations, because the student gives the authors' surnames in the sentence, the brackets only need to contain the publication year. Also notice how the third example gives the authors' names (because they were not given in the sentence) and a page number because they are providing a quote. 

#### Part 2: The reference list
As with the rules about referencing in the body of your work, the way you reference at the end of your work is determined by which referencing style guide you use. Usually at the end of your work, you need to provide a reference list, which is a list of all the sources you referred to in the body of your work. Your lecturer may ask you to provide a bibliography, which is a list of all the sources you consulted in the course of studying for the assignment, including the ones you did not refer to in the assignment body.

There are many differences in the way the different styles present their reference lists. However, common across all the styles is that the lists are:
* In alphabetical order; and
* Organised by the author’s surname.

Another commonality is that all the styles require more detailed information in the reference list than in the body references. However, this is where the commonalities stop. To find out how to do reference list entries, you will need to look at the appropriate referencing style guide.

#### Style guides
To figure out whether you need to use in text citations or footnotes, or how to present the information in your reference lists, you first need to know which referencing style guide you have to use. Much like different languages have different dictionaries, different referencing styles have different referencing style guides. Referencing style guides are books that give the details of how to reference in that particular style.

Your area of study will often determine which referencing style you have to use. ANU has no single referencing style, as different disciplines prefer different styles. We recommend Monash Guide in Professional Practice course. For other courses, you should ask your lecturers. 

When to reference
Every time you use information from a source, you need to give a citation for it. This means that you have to give a citation whenever you:
1. Quote
2. Paraphrase or summarise
3. Use another source (e.g. an image, data, figures)

This module gives more information about referencing and referencing style guides. To learn more about referencing, you can also visit the Academic Skills and Learning Centre website to access resources, find out when drop ins are on, or book an appointment. 


#### Tools for referencing

Referencing takes a while to get used to, and it is easy to make small mistakes. There are many software tools that can make it easier. However, you have to be careful, as they do not always give accurate results, and are only as accurate as the information that you put into them.


|  | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Microsoft Word referencing tool](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-a-citation-and-create-a-bibliography-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) | Easy to use, available | Inflexible, have to install extra styles|
| [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) | Free, easy to use, integrates into MS Word, helps organise PDF documents | Takes time to set up, no training or support |
| [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) | Free, easy to use, integrates into MS Word, Firefox and Chrome | Takes time to set up, no training or support, can be complicated for new users |
| [EndNote](http://libguides.anu.edu.au/endnote-x7) | Free for ANU students, the library offers training and support | Takes time to set up, can be complicated for new users, does not have as many features as other free tools |
| Google citation tool | NOT RECOMMENDED | Styles are often inconsistent, with missing information and incorrect formatting |
| Online citation generators (Cite For Me, etc.)| NOT RECOMMENDED | Styles are often inconsistent, with missing information and incorrect formatting |


Even if you choose to use a tool, you need to be familiar with your referencing style in order to spot mistakes. Being able to check a reference list manually is an important skill for all students and academics.



## Referencing Mechanics
All of the examples in this resource are in Harvard referencing style. In Professional Practice courses, you course you could use any of these styles: Harvard/APA/IEEE. Links to these styles are on ANU Academic Skills’ academic integrity site.

### In-text citations
The first component to a reference is an in-text citation. Citations help to point the reader to the sources you used when writing your assignment. They are used after quotations, paraphrases, or when you want to refer to work that supports your idea. For example:
1. Khurana and Michas (2011) report that US home bias…
2. …as shown in the case of US home bias (Khurana & Michas 2011).

These are both accurate citations, but they differ in style.

Example 1 is called an ‘author-prominent’ citation. You can use this style of citation when you want to draw the reader’s attention to the authors of the paper. Often this is done when you want to focus on the ideas of particular authors, perhaps because of their prominence in the field.

Example 2 is called an ‘information-prominent’ citation. You can do this when you are more interested in the idea than the authors. Note that the ‘&’ symbol is used in the citation when you have more than one author.

Your assignments will have a mixture of author- and information-prominent citations. Remember that variety makes your writing more interesting to read.

### Reference list?
This is an example of a reference in Harvard style, as it would appear in the reference list:

Wolfe, K, Wu, X & Liu, RH 2003, ‘Antioxidant activity of apple peels’, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, vol. 51, no. 3, pp. 609–614.

Let’s break the reference down into parts.

* Wolfe, K, Wu, X & Liu, RH

These are the authors’ names. You can see that there are three authors of this paper. Note that the last names come first, followed by their initials. We will talk about how to identity first and last names on the next page.

* 2003

This is the year the article was published. It is important, because it appears in the citation.

* ‘Antioxidant activity of apple peels’

The title of the paper. Note that it is enclosed in single quotation marks: ‘ ‘

* Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry

The title of the journal in which the article was published. This is presented in italics in Harvard style.

* vol. 51, no. 3

Journals are published in regular cycles. Typically, the volume number (vol.) changes each year. Many journals publish multiple issues per year; this is shown by the issue or number (no.).

* pp. 609–614

The page range of the article in the journal. Remember that even though you may have found the journal article online, many issues are still published in hard-copy. That is why you do not need a URL in a journal article reference.

### Writing a reference list
In Harvard style, you must sort your references alphabetically (A, B, C, etc.). This is what a reference list looks like at the end of a paper:

Have a look at the references in this list. There are five of them and many look different. Try to guess what kind of source each reference is. Is it a book, journal article, website, or something else?

Your style guide will show you how to format each type of source accurately. Be sure to follow the guide closely, and apply its rules consistently. Inconsistent referencing is a common way for students to lose marks.

## Paraphrasing, Summarising and Quoting
Referencing is important, but it is useless if you do not know how to accurately paraphrase, summarise or quote in your work. All three need to be followed by an in-text citation.

1. Summarising
  * Concisely explains someone’s argument in your own words.
  * The aim is to capture the essence of the argument, so a summary focuses on the main ideas only.
  * You could use this to summarise an entire book or chapter, for example in a literature review.

2. Paraphrasing
  * Uses the skill of summarisation.
  * Explains someone’s idea in detail, using your own words.
  * The aim is to provide more specific detail of an author’s argument.
  * Your paraphrase could refer to a sentence or short passage from the original source.

3. Quotation
  * Copying others’ words exactly.
  * Quotations marks must be used.
  * Usually you cannot make any alterations to a quote. However, there are important exceptions to this that we explore later.

## Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing is when you reword a short section of writing into your own words. Paraphrasing is similar to summarising since it involves putting the author(s)' words into your own words. However, paraphrasing is different to summarising because it focuses on just one or two ideas in the source rather than capturing the main idea of the entire source. Paraphrasing is an important skill that demonstrates your ability to articulate an author’s idea or piece of evidence in your own words and in turn your understanding of the content. Paraphrasing is useful in supporting your argument with evidence rephrased in your own words. The idea is still the same as the original and must be correctly acknowledged. A paraphrase will always require a citation.

### What is bad paraphrasing?
The hardest step of paraphrasing is in putting the text into your own words. A bad paraphrase occurs when the the words and structure of the sentence is too similar to the original text. For instance, if the original text is the sentence below:

Then a bad paraphrase would be: 

| **Original Text** |
| -- |
| “While sensation fiction does not generally include overtly occult episodes, it does use occultized images to depict crime and social evils” (Steere 2008, p. 302).|

Then a bad paraphrase would be: 

| **BAD PARAPHRASE** | 
| -- |
| Although sensation fiction does not in general include overtly occult scenes, it does use occultized images to show crime and social evils (Steere 2008, p. 302). |

This is bad because only a few of the words are changed, and the structure of the sentence is too much the same. It does not show the student's understanding of the concept. A paraphrase is considered good when it shows your understanding of the idea.You might find it useful to approach paraphrasing using a series of steps that are outlined below. 

### Bad paraphrasing in Turnitin
Turnitin can help you identify when paraphrasing is too similar to the original source. The example below shows a writer’s attempt at paraphrasing the above information. Turnitin has identified a match to many of the words. The original source has been revealed and shows how the writing closely resembles the original article. Although the writer has included a reference, this is an indication to this writer that they should rephrase this sentence as the words and phrasing are too close to the original.

<img width="775" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 12 46 22 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225791137-4f38ee7d-6620-440d-ab34-b190b31388e8.png">



If you get a text match like this one, it is a sign that you need to explain the idea differently. The following section offers advice on how to paraphrase well. 


## Paraphrasing: Identify what you understand
Paraphrasing is a crucial component of academic writing. In many disciplines, paraphrasing is preferred over quoting. This is because when you paraphrase, you also demonstrate your understanding and critical analysis of the text. There are a range of ways to paraphrase effectively, including the following steps and strategies.

### Select the text
First, select the section of the text that you want to use. For example, say that you wanted to paraphrase the following text: 

| **ORIGINAL TEXT** |
| -- |
| “While sensation fiction does not generally include overtly occult episodes, it does use occultized images to depict crime and social evils” (Steere 2008, p. 302). |

Your next step would be to figure out what it is that you understand in the text, and put that into your own words. 

### Ask yourself what you understand from the text

To help put the idea in your own words, it is useful to ask yourself what you think the text means. You could ask the following questions to do this: 
* What is the main idea here?
* How could I explain this idea to someone who doesn't know the topic?
* What do I understand about this and what do I not understand?
* How could I explain this idea to another person in my class?
* How could I break this information down into smaller parts?
* What do each of the smaller parts of this information mean?


If you are finding it difficult to answer these questions, you could instead test out these strategies: 

* Read the sentence out aloud, then look away from the sentence and try to explain the idea (it may be useful to record yourself doing this, so that you can listen back to what you said)
* Draw a diagram of the information and then explain to yourself or to someone else the connections between the ideas. For example: 


<img width="769" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 12 52 08 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225791910-fac2538a-1b4d-4010-9597-89ced4568c5d.png">


The bad-to-good paraphrasing method

Another option that you could try would be to first of all to do a bad paraphrase, then keep on changing it to help you explain the information differently. First, start by changing the words that you can change into words that you understand more clearly. For instance, you could say: 


| Sensation fiction does not usually include very overt occult episodes, but it does use occult images when it shows crime and social problems (Steere 2008, p. 302) |
| -- |

Now, you would have to change this bad paraphrase again, to make it more different from the original text. One way that you could do this would be to change the order of the information. For instance, you could write: 

| Sensation fiction uses occult images when it depicts crime and social problems, although it does not use openly occult episodes (Steere 2008, p. 302). |
| -- |

However, this is still too close to the original, and doesn't necessarily show your understanding of the idea. You could at this point aim to separate the information and explain it to yourself using simple words. For instance, separating the information out might look like this: 

  * Sensation fiction uses occult images in scenes to do with crime and other social problems (Steere 2008, p. 302). 

  * But occult images are different to occult episodes (Steere 2008, p. 302).

  * Occult episodes are often long and intense, and make the reader question whether or not they are real (Brown 2010).

  * This means that they are distinct scenes, whereas occult images are only subtle things like when a thief's quickness is compared to a ghost - but the author is not suggesting that the thief is actually a ghost.

  * According to Steere, sensation fiction only uses subtle, occult images, not distinct scenes (Steere 2008, p. 302). 


From here, you can see more easily how the information fits together. You can also see that while doing this, the student has been careful to use citations to note down where the information came from. Although it may not look like this in the final version, this is a useful strategy when drafting to remind yourself which ideas need citations.

The next step is to put the idea in your own words and show your own understanding. 


## Paraphrasing: Put the idea in your own words
Once you understand the ideas, it is time to write a paraphrase using your own words. For example, based on our understanding of the idea presented in the original sentence: 

| **Original Text** |
| -- |
| “While sensation fiction does not generally include overtly occult episodes, it does use occultized images to depict crime and social evils” (Steere 2008, p. 302). |


A fair paraphrase would be something like the following: 

| Sensation fiction uses elements of the occult when it depicts crime and social problems, although it cannot be said to use distinctly occult scenes (Steere 2008, p. 302). |

This is a fair example of paraphrasing, as it explains the main idea clearly in the student's own words. When we put this paraphrase into Turnitin, it did not find a text match. 

Here is another example of a fair paraphrase, which Turnitin did not identify as a text match. You can see that the student has used the author's name in their sentence, to make it clear that the idea belongs to the author: 

<img width="771" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-17 at 12 56 14 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125527438/225792455-b26b0746-8fbb-44c8-bdc8-d096dca450bd.png">


While these are all fair examples of text matches, they don't show us the student's own critical analysis of the idea. Finally, to emphasise your own critical interpretation of the ideas, you can consider the final step below. 


## Paraphrasing: Show your critical interpretation
When you are ready to do this, it is also important to think about what part of the idea you want to emphasise. You can also at this stage think about how you're going to show your critical interpretation of the idea. Is it an important idea? Is it an unusual idea? Do you agree or disagree with it? You can signal your critical interpretation of the idea in the types of words that you use to paraphrase. For example, you could show a lot of critical interpretation by adding a few words like the ones highlighted in these examples: 

| 1. Example of a paraphrase showing agreement with the source text |
| -- |
| Steere (2008, p. 302) convincingly argues that when sensation fiction focuses on social problems, it occasionally uses imagery that is supernatural but does not present entire occult scenes. |


| 2. Example of a paraphrase showing disagreement with the source text |
| -- |
| In one problematic account, Steere (2008, p. 302) asserts that sensation fiction uses elements of the occult when it depicts crime and social problems, but that it does not use distinctly occult scenes. Analysis of sensation texts does not support this view, as for example, in the book … |

These added phrases ("convincingly argues", "In one problematic account") indicate much more about your interpretation or assessment of the idea. You would then in most cases need to support your assessment with some evidence to explain why the theory is either ground-breaking, convincing, or unusual. To learn more about how to show your critical interpretation within your writing, you can go to this site's section on Authorial Voice. 

### A word of warning
You may have seen online paraphrasing generators that take an excerpt of text and replace some of the words. These do not work because they do not produce genuine paraphrases. If you use them, it could be seen as misconduct or plagiarism. There really is no shortcut to actually understanding the source and paraphrasing it accurately.


## Summarising: Start with your question

A summary is a succinct overview of a source, which distils the key ideas of the author’s argument. It is much shorter than the original text, which could be several paragraphs in length to an entire book. Similar to paraphrasing, when summarising you articulate the author’s argument or ideas in your own words. Summarising demonstrates your critical engagement with an author’s argument by the way you selectively choose to highlight relevant aspects of the source. The ideas are still the same as the original and must use a citation.

In order to summarise effectively, you need to be able to identify the relevant information for your purpose. When you read, it will save you time and energy in the long run to start by identifying the question that you want to answer while reading the text. Tutorial questions, essay questions, and research questions are key places to find questions that can guide you through the reading. If you're doing reading for tutorials that don't have set questions, it's a good idea to develop some of your own. For instance, how does the reading demonstrate the week's topic? How is it similar or different to the other ideas that the course presents? 

Once you know your question, it is time to search through the text to see how it answers your question. For the following example, we're using the question: to what extent do the outcomes of bush burning practices justify their risks to wildlife? 


## Summarising: Identify the main idea and subpoints
Once you know your question, it is time to search through the text to see how it answers your question. This involves assessing how relevant the text is for your assignment question or topic. For the following example, we're using the question: to what extent do the outcomes of bush burning practices justify their risks to wildlife? 

Since a summary gives an overview of a source, you need to understand the author(s)' argument. Reading strategically can help you to quickly identify this. To find the author(s)' main argument, first read through the source's abstract (if it has one), its introduction, and its conclusion. This should give you a general idea of the main argument. 

For example, read the journal article abstract below. Can you identify the main argument?

___
Studies of conservation in small scale societies typically portray indigenous peoples as either sustainably managing resources, or forsaking long-term sustainability for short-term gains. To explain this variability, we propose an alternative framework derived from a co-evolutionary perspective. In environments with long histories of consistent interaction, we suggest that local species will frequently be well adapted to human disturbance; but where novel interactions are introduced, human disturbance may have negative environmental consequences. To test this co-evolutionary hypothesis, we examine the effect of Aboriginal burning and hunting on hill kangaroo (Macropus robustus) abundance. We find that hill kangaroo populations peak at intermediate levels of human disturbance, showing that in ecosystems characterized by long-term human-environmental interactions, humans can act as trophic mediators, resulting in patterns consistent with epiphenomenal conservation. Framing the question within this co-evolutionary perspective provides an explanation for the underlying mechanisms that drive environmental outcomes of subsistence practices.

Abstract from p. 659 of: Codding, BF, Bird, RB, Kauhanen, PG, & Bird, DW 2014, 'Conservation or co-evolution? Intermediate levels of Aboriginal burning and hunting have positive effects on kangaroo populations in Western Australia', Human Ecology, vol. 42, no. 5, pp. 659-669. 
___

Based on this abstract, we can see that the authors' argument is "In environments with long histories of consistent interaction, we suggest that local species will frequently be well adapted to human disturbance; but where novel interactions are introduced, human disturbance may have negative environmental consequences" (Codding et al. 2014, p. 659). In other words, Codding et al. are hypothesising that humans' impact on animals and the environment may be worse if human intervention is irregular rather than consistent. Their findings support this argument.

For our essay on whether the outcomes of burning practices justify their risk to wildlife, we can see that this article provides useful evidence because the authors are arguing that regular bush burning causes the least risk to wildlife. 

### Identify the subpoints
Now that you understand the main argument, to identify the key ideas and subpoints within the author(s)' argument, the next step is to skim through the subheadings and, when you find a very relevant section to answer your question, the topic sentences of that section. A topic sentence is the first sentence of a paragraph. Just reading through topic sentences should give you an indication of which parts you want to study in detail.

For example, from reading the topic sentences in the article and putting them into our own words, we have found that the author's key points include:

  * Humans significantly affect wildlife (Codding et al. 2014, p. 660)
  * The theory of co-evolution can show us whether humans' influence is negative or positive (p. 660)
  * Places where Aboriginal practices of burning (and hunting) have regularly occurred provide the location for testing the hypothesis (p. 660)
  * Kangaroos are prevalent in those areas (p. 665)
  * Kangaroos do best with a medium amount of human interference, and bush burning has a larger positive impact compared to hunting (p. 665)
  * The technique of burning is highly encouraged to maintain wildlife survival (p. 666)


## Summarising: Translate the ideas into your own words
Now that you have identified the key ideas, you can select the parts that you think are most relevant to answer your question, and study them in detail. For your summary, it is at this stage where you might identify further ideas that are worth pointing out.

When you study texts in detail, don't simply highlight - otherwise you might end up with a whole page of neon yellow and this can be hard to reread later. Instead, take notes of your own. This will enable you to process the information more effectively. Ask yourself questions as you go, identify what you don't understand, show yourself the links between the different ideas by using arrows, numbers, explanations and so forth, and note down how the text answers your question. 

### Summarising the article
To write a good summary, you need to put the author(s)' ideas in your own words. Some strategies to do this include:

  * Closing the article and opening a blank page where you write down in your own words what you thought the article was about
  * Translating the author's main argument into words and phrases that you prefer and are able to easily understand  
  * Looking at your notes and writing another summary of your notes using different words

For example, based on the notes we took when we analysed the article in the 4 steps above, a succinct summary might be: Codding et al.'s (2014) findings demonstrate that Aboriginal practices of regular and moderate-impact bush burning and hunting have a positive effect on sustaining kangaroo populations. 

In this example, we have summarised the key argument of the whole article, without having to quote or paraphrase. Notice that a citation is still necessary, because the ideas still belong to Codding et al., but that the citation does not include a page number because the idea is expressed throughout the entire article. 

### What should a summary look like in Turnitin?
Generally Turnitin will not find matches with summaries unless you have selected phrases that directly match the original source. You will usually find that the references that accompany your summaries and other sources will find matches in Turnitin. The example below illustrates how a summary with its accompanying reference might look on a Turnitin originality report.

## Quoting

A quotation is easier to do than a paraphrase, but it is also easy to get wrong.

A quotation must be:

Copied from the source exactly, including emphasis, spelling, and any mistakes the original author may have made.
Enclosed in quotation marks.
Followed by a citation and a page number.
You should not rely on quotations to make your argument. There are times when quoting is appropriate, and times when it is not.

Quote when:

  * It emphatically reinforces your own ideas.
  * The language is particularly effective.
  * Paraphrasing would distort the original.

Don’t quote when:
  * You could paraphrase the idea more effectively.
  * The passage you want is too long.
  * When you already have many quotations in your work.

Don’t forget that you need to ‘introduce’ your quotations with your own words, as in the example below, rather than letting your quotation take up an entire sentence on its own.

Quotation is particularly useful when you need to cite specific details. See a sample quote:

___

According to Woolworths’ chairman Gordon Cairns, the company had ‘disappointing’ financial results, leading to ‘a reduced final dividend of 33 cents per share, down 54.2% on prior year’ (Woolworths Limited 2016, p. 10).

___

Note how the words in quotation marks are the chairman’s exact words. They also have an introduction and a citation with a page number, so the reader can find the original quote themselves.

### What if I need a long quotation?
There are times when you cannot avoid quoting something that is very long. When a quotation is more than four lines, you must format it differently.

Long quotations are indented from the main text and do not need quotation marks. They also require some introductory text in your own words. For example:

___
Woolworths’ chairman Gordon Cairns noted in the company's annual report (Woolworths Limited 2016, p. 10) that:

We have optimised our store network with the planned closure of 30 stores, and a further 34 stores impaired due to the uncertainty surrounding lease renewals. As a result of the above restructuring, we booked significant items from continuing operations before interest and tax of $958.6 million. We have also pivoted our capex spending on stores towards refurbishing our existing network, with over 80 Australian Supermarkets planned for the upcoming year. To complement the above, a revitalised incentive structure was introduced for our core businesses which focuses on the key drivers of the business, both short and long term, and rewards management for transformation. These incentive schemes apply uniformly down to store management.
___

Only use long quotations when it is unavoidable. Paraphrasing is usually preferred because it shows more engagement with and understanding of the source material.

### What if I need to make a minor change to a quotation?
Usually, a quotation is copied exactly from the original source. However, there are times when it is permitted to make small changes to help the flow of your writing.

#### Removing text
Sometimes you might not want to include something in the middle of the sentence because it is irrelevant to your argument. You can skip it using ellipsis …

  * Chairman Gordon Cairns notes that 'we are building a strong management team … with some key hires across the business' (Woolworths Limited 2016, p. 10).

Be careful when using ellipsis not to remove too much text or misrepresent the meaning of the original.

#### Changes or additions
Square brackets \[ \] are used to make small changes to the grammar of the sentence. This is useful when the quotation requires an adjustment to its grammar in order to fit in with your writing.

  * He goes on to state that 'sales from continuing operations [were] down marginally to $58.1 billion' (Woolworths Limited 2016, p. 10).

#### Mistakes in the original
Published sources can have typos or grammatical errors. If you need to quote a passage that has a mistake in it, you can use [sic] to show that the mistake is the original author’s, not your own.

  * One study found 'investors value there [sic] money' (Jackson 2016, p. 76).

## Case study: Woolworths Limited
he following sections use examples from Woolworths’ 2016 annual report to demonstrate how to summarise, paraphrase and quote.

When citing a report, the company is treated as the author.

### Citation
  * Woolworths Limited (2016)
  * (Woolworths Limited 2016)

### Reference
Woolworths Limited 2016, Annual Report 2016, viewed 22 June 2017, <https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/icms_docs/185865_annual-report-2016.pdf>


### Example of Summarising
On pages 8 and 9 they present a visual overview of the company’s performance in 2016. This sort of high-level information is ideal for a summary. For example:

___
In 2016, Woolworths Limited (2016) reported a sharp drop in ordinary earnings and dividend payout, compared to the previous year. Earnings also dropped sharply in the face of a dip in sales, alongside a slight increase in operating capital expenditure.
___

The summary covers large parts of the report without going into too much detail about the actual dollar figures and percentages.



### Example of Paraphrasing

The following text comes from the chairman's report in Woolworths' annual report (Woolworths Limited 2016, p. 10):

___
We are building a strong management team, led by Brad, with some key hires across the business. This has been complemented by a renewal of the Board with 50% gender diversity, and key skills added in retailing, international and private equity. Together we will help shape an achievement culture. […]

The financial results for the year were disappointing, with sales from continuing operations down marginally to $58.1 billion and net profit after tax from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of Woolworths before significant items down 39.2% to $1.6 billion. As a result, the Board have announced a reduced final dividend of 33 cents per share, down 54.2% on prior year.
___

A paraphrase aims to capture more detail than a simple summary. This means focusing on a particular section of the report. In this example, we have chosen to focus on the chairman’s report. A paraphrase of this section may look like the following:

___
Woolworths chairman Gordon Cairns states in the company’s annual report (Woolworths Limited 2016, p. 10) that the renewal of the company’s board has led to a strengthened management team, with increased diversity and additional skills. This, he argues, will lift the performance of the company, particularly in light of disappointing financial results for the year.
___

Note how the paraphrase captures the ideas expressed in the original text, but uses different wording and sentence structure.


### Example of Quoting

Quotation is particularly useful when you need to cite specific details. See a sample quote:

___
According to Woolworths’ chairman Gordon Cairns, the company had ‘disappointing’ financial results, leading to ‘a reduced final dividend of 33 cents per share, down 54.2% on prior year’ (Woolworths Limited 2016, p. 10).
___

Note how the words in quotation marks are the chairman’s exact words. They also have an introduction and a citation with a page number, so the reader can find the original quote themselves.
