This week we will learn the application of ethics in Engineering/Computer Science industry, with a key focus on:

  * Ethical decision making and techniques
  * Codes of practice that govern our decision making and behaviour
  

# Ethical decision making
Professionals every day need to make decisions to consider the best action to take in relation to any given problem. It is easy to make simple decisions, like "What will I eat for breakfast?" or "What time do I need to get up to get to my lecture on time?". Sometimes the result of a decision may have greater impact on our audience or ourselves. This is when we need to think more carefully about our choices, actions and the impact. 

Ethical decision-making refers to the process of evaluating and choosing among alternatives in a manner consistent with ethical principles. In making ethical decisions, it is necessary to perceive and eliminate unethical options and select the best ethical alternative. Good decisions are both ethical and effective (Blink, 2020):

* Ethical decisions generate and sustain trust; demonstrate respect, responsibility, fairness and caring; and are consistent with good citizenship. These behaviors provide a foundation for making better decisions by setting the ground rules for our behavior.
* Effective decisions are effective if they accomplish what we want accomplished and if they advance our purposes. A choice that produces unintended and undesirable results is ineffective. The key to making effective decisions is to think about choices in terms of their ability to accomplish our most important goals. This means we have to understand the difference between immediate and short-term goals and longer-range goals.


# Ethical codes
As engineering and computing professionals practitioners, we use our knowledge and skills for the benefit of the community to create solutions for a sustainable future. In doing so, we strive to serve the community ahead of other personal or sectional interests. Ethical choices are not always black and white. Sometimes there are grey areas and this is where a code of ethics and professional conduct will be your best resource for solving these dilemmas. Watch Code of Conduct and Ethics for Employees by KnowledgeCity to learn more (2:25 mins).


# Engineering code of ethics
Engineers Australia (EA) Code of Ethics defines the values and principles that shape the decisions engineers make in engineering practice. The related Guidelines on Professional Conduct provide a framework for engineers to use when exercising their judgment in the practice of engineering. The Guidelines are not intended to be, nor should they be interpreted as, a full or exhaustive list of the situations and circumstances which may comprise compliance and non compliance with the Code of Ethics. [Read the EA Code of Ethics here](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/ethics). In summary, 

In the course of engineering practice, you must: 

1. Demonstrate integrity. 

  1.1 Act on the basis of a well-informed conscience; 
  
  1.2 Be honest and trustworthy; 
  
  1.3 Respect the dignity of all persons

2. Practise competently. 

  2.1 Maintain and develop knowledge and skills;
  
  2.2 Represent areas of competence objectively; 
  
  2.3 Act on the basis of adequate knowledge

3. Exercise leadership. 

  3.1 Uphold the reputation and trustworthiness of the practice of engineering; 
  
  3.2 Support and encourage diversity;
  
  3.3 Communicate honestly and effectively, taking into account the reliance of others on engineering expertise 

4. Promote sustainability. 

  4.1 Engage responsibly with the community and other stakeholders; 
  
  4.2 Practise engineering to foster the health, safety and wellbeing of the community  and the environment; 
  
  4.3 Balance the needs of the present with the needs of future generations
  
  
# Computing code of ethics
As computer science professionals, we use our knowledge and skills for the benefit of the community to create hardware and software solutions for a sustainable future. In doing so, we strive to serve the community ahead of other personal or sectional interests. The Australian Computer Society (ACS) Code of Professional Conduct defines the values and principles that shape the decisions professionals make in computer science profession. The related Guidelines on Professional Conduct provide a framework for computer scientists to use when exercising their judgment in the practice of their profession. The Guidelines are not intended to be, nor should they be interpreted as, a full or exhaustive list of the situations and circumstances which may comprise compliance and non compliance with the Code of Professional Conduct.

ACS Code of Professional Conduct (the Code) identifies following six core ethical values and the associated requirements for professional conduct. The Society requires its members to abide by these values, and act with responsibility and integrity in all of their professional dealings. [Read the details of ACS Code of Conduct here.](https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/rules-and-regulations/Code-of-Professional-Conduct_v2.1.pdf) 

In summary and in the course of computing practice, you must consider:

1. The Primacy of the Public Interest. 

You will place the interests of the public above those of personal, business or sectional interests. 

2. The Enhancement of Quality of Life. 

You will strive to enhance the quality of life of those affected by your work. 

3. Honesty. 

You will be honest in your representation of skills, knowledge, services and products. 

4. Competence.

You will work competently and diligently for your stakeholders. 

5. Professional Development.

You will enhance your own professional development, and that of your staff. 

6. Professionalism.

You will enhance the integrity of the ACS and the respect of its members for each other.


# Doing the ethics technique
In some situations, thinking ethically can be difficult because there is often no right or wrong choice. It is often upto the individuals to exercise their professional judgement as to how best to solve the problem they are dealing with ([Simpson, 2003](https://journal.acs.org.au/index.php/ajis/article/view/159/141)). Although there are numerous ways of analysing ethical issues, in Australia, one that is well published is the "Doing Ethics Technique (DET)". 

DET uses a series of questions to explore the issues the professional is facing and uses the answers to help develop satisfactory outcomes. Although there is no best solution, but by following a systematic guideline such as DET, it is more likely that the outcome will be a good one, even if it may not be the best.

The DET revolves around the resolution of the following questions, taken in this particular order:

1. What is going on?
2. What are the facts?
3. What are the issues?
4. Who is affected?

This leads to:

5. What are the ethical issues and implications?
6. What can be done about it?
7. What options are there?
8. Which option is best-and why?
