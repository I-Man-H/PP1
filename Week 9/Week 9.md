# Case Study

McDermid (2008) introduces DET using a case study example from the Sydney Olympic Games. SOCOG senior officials were subject to multiple enquiries regarding their professional practice. One particular allegation related to the website and involved direct issues of ethical practice.


[Read about the SOCOG case here](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/pluginfile.php/3288716/mod_lesson/page_contents/127107/Ethics%20-%20An%20Australian%20perspective%20%282%29.pdf?time=1597459286255) and practice applying the DET technique using this [template](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/pluginfile.php/3288716/mod_lesson/page_contents/127107/DET%20template.docx).

# Group Project

Discuss about ethical challenges of your own group project. You can use DET template to map out some of the key ethical challenges of your project (however, you shouldn’t feel constraint using the tool)​

Think critically about your own values (individually) when you discuss your ethics in your project as a group. And how that affects the way you think about ethical challenges differently.
