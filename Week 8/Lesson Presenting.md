# Introduction
Welcome to Week 8!


This week, we will focus on developing presentations skills. Presentation skills are important for individual and business success, leadership and stakeholders engagement in Engineering and Computer Science industries.

This week we will:

  * Learn about Assertion-Evidence (AE) based presentation.
  Adjust delivery for public presentations.
  Build team skills.

We encourage you to complete the quiz before the tutorial. You are allowed to access the lesson content as many times as you wish but quiz questions can only be attempted once. 


# Assertion Evidence Based Presentations
Assertion-Evidence slide design is characterized by : 

  * A concise, complete sentence headline (no longer than 2 lines) that states the main assertion (i.e. what you want the audience to know).
  Visual evidence for that assertion (charts, graphs, images, equations, etc. - the body of the slide 
  Reference at the bottom of the slide.

## Are AEB presentations more effective?

AEB presentations are more effective because the slides are simple yet powerful due to visuals. 

When a speaker uses text-heavy, bulleted slides, it can lead to cognitive overload â€” otherwise known as Death by PowerPoint. Whether words are spoken or written, they are processed in the same part of the brain. Since a talk itself is composed of words, when a presenter has slides that are primarily text, the audience will often only read the slides or only listen to the presenter. Additionally, bullets do not show connections or relationships between the content being presented. As a result, it is difficult for the audience to determine the most important information on the slide. This issue is magnified in a scientific presentation that contains challenging content ([TED Blog 2012](https://blog.ted.com/6-tips-on-how-scientists-and-engineers-can-excite-rather-than-bore-an-audience/)).

Therefore, lack of text, use of visuals, and delivery of the message around those visuals make AEB presentations more understandable, memorable and persuasive compared to traditional bullet point presentations.

## Key principles of AEB Presentations

  1. Build your talk on messages (not topics). 
  2. Support these messages with visual evidence (not bullet lists).
  3. Explain this evidence by fashioning words on the spot. 
  
A talk built on key messages is more focused than a talk built on topics. Moreover, audiences understand visual evidence more readily than they do bullet lists. Third, a speaker who fashions sentences on the spot (after planning and practice) is much more engaging and appears much more confident than a speaker who reads bullet lists. Using these principles, the assertion-evidence structure makes your presentation more focused and better understood ([Alley n.d.](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/tutorial.html)).

# How to prepare AEB presentations
As we learned in the previous chapter, AEB slides are an effective way to deliver the message to the audience. In addition to the slides, the pitch is equally important for engaging the audience. 

For a powerful presentation, where do you start? how much detail do you give? what does your listener already know? what does your listener even want to know? how you resolve these questions will shape the way different types of people receive your message. Engaging with non-technical audiences will occur throughout your career, and the way you communicate your ideas can impact how others perceive your work (Hoffenson, 2016). Watch the Hoffenson talk about how to effectively share technical ideas with non-technical audiences (5.38 mins).

Prepare AEB presentations using these three guidelines. Using these principles, the assertion-evidence structure makes your presentation more focused and better understood (Alley n.d.). 

  1. Build your talk on messages (not topics): A talk built on key messages is more focused than a talk built on topics
  2. Support these messages with visual evidence (not bullet lists): Audiences understand visual evidence more readily than they do bullet lists. 
  3. Explain this evidence by fashioning words on the spot: A speaker who fashions sentences on the spot (after planning and practice) is much more engaging and appears much more confident than a speaker who reads bullet lists 

## Planning your AEB presentation
Because no bullet lists occur in an assertion-evidence talk, this type of presentation demands more preparation from you. In essence, you flesh out the story of your work by explaining the visual evidence. This increased role for you as a speaker increases your credibility because rather than reading from the slide, you show ownership of the content (Alley n.d.). Follow these three (3) simple steps when planning an effective AEB presentation. 

  1. Before opening PowerPoint  on your computer, you should first write down the main messages on your next talk (please note that a message is a complete sentence). These messages should tell a coherent and compelling story about your work. 
  2. Using the template, have each message serve as a sentence headline for the slides. Support those headlines with visual evidence and place secondary details into the notes pages of the slides. 
  3. Finally, critique your slides using the [following checklist](http://www.writing.engr.psu.edu/AE_checklist.pdf) (Alley n.d.)


# Delivering an AEB presentation
Do you feel nervous before presentations? Does the thought of public speaking makes you anxious?

**First**, embrace the fact that you are not alone! Even the most successful public speakers had those feelings once upon a time. They key to ease nervous is to practice and to deliver several presentations to feel more comfortable with public speaking.

**Second**, "power posing" is a good method to feel less anxious. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy argues that "power posing" -- standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident -- can boost feelings of confidence, and might have an impact on our chances for success.
